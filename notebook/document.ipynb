Overview \\n◼ What is your intention to come to Taiwan for this internship? \\nI am eager to join this internship because it represents both professional and personal growth \\nopportunity. Professionally, I aim to strengthen my research and programming skills in machine \\nlearning for materials science. Personally, I’m excited to experience Taiwan’s culture and work with \\npeople from diverse backgrounds, which I believe will enrich my perspective as a future researcher. \\n◼ Please describe your gains and experience acquired from this internship. \\nDuring my internship in Taiwan, I gained hands-on experience with the CrystalFormer project, \\nwhere I learned how machine learning can be applied to crystal structure prediction. I became more \\nskilled in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I also learned how to \\ncollaborate in a research group, communicate technical ideas effectively, and document results \\nclearly. This internship strengthened my motivation to pursue further research at the intersection of \\nAI and material science. \\n◼ Please describe your life in Taiwan, how to deal with difficulties? \\nMy life in Taiwan has been inspiring and full of growth. I enjoy the peaceful environment, kind people, \\nand the culture of respect and collaboration. At first, I faced difficulties such as language barriers and \\nadapting to new food and climate, but I dealt with them through patience, curiosity, and support from \\nmy colleagues and local friends. Each challenge helped me become more independent and confident. \\n◼ During the internship, what impressed you most and made you recommend the \\ninternship to your friends? \\nI was most impressed by how welcoming and supportive everyone was, both in the lab and outside. I \\nlearned a lot not only about research but also about teamwork and cultural exchange. The kindness \\nof people in Taiwan and the collaborative atmosphere made this internship a truly special experience \\nthat I would recommend to my friends. \\n◼ If there is any other similar chance for you to choose, would you like to \\nparticipate in this program again? And why? \\nSure! I would gladly participate again. The internship allowed me to work on the interesting project, \\ndeepen my understanding of machine learning in materials science, and grow as a young researcher. \\nThe welcoming environment, helpful mentors, and inspiring research culture in Taiwan made this \\nexperience unforgettable and one I would love to repeat. \\n◼ Please describe during your internship, which PI and institute have you \\ncommunicated or interacted with? \\nThroughout my internship, I mainly communicated with Professor Ying Jer Kao and the research \\nteam at National Taiwan University. Our discussions focused on the CrystalFormer project, where I \\ncontributed to data preprocessing, dataset curation, and analysis. I also interacted with another lab \\nmember from Physics department to share progress updates during group meetings.'),\n",
